  bio: "Dr. Sushil Kumar Patle is a Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon at Patle Health Care Center, Adhartal, Jabalpur. Trained with an M.B.B.S., D.Ortho, and M.Ch. Ortho (USAIM), he also holds a Fellowship in Rheumatology — an uncommon combination that lets him treat both the injuries that need a surgeon and the arthritis that needs a physician. The clinic runs its own digital X-ray and physiotherapy centre, so most patients are diagnosed, treated, and rehabilitated at one address.",
