Possible causes include delayed healing, a bone that united in poor alignment, or joint stiffness from the immobilisation itself.

Apply ice wrapped in cloth, keep the limb raised, and avoid letting the person walk on a painful leg. Don't massage the area or pull on the limb to 'set' it.

        answer:
          "Osteoarthritis is mechanical — cartilage wearing down with age and load, usually in knees, hips, and spine, worse with activity. Rheumatoid arthritis is your immune system attacking the joint lining — it prefers the small joints of hands and feet, strikes both sides symmetrically, and is worst in the morning. The distinction isn't academic: rheumatoid arthritis untreated causes permanent joint destruction, and its medicines are completely different from pain relief.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why should I see a doctor with rheumatology training instead of taking painkillers from the chemist?",
        answer:
          "Painkillers hide the pain while inflammatory arthritis continues damaging the joint underneath — patients often arrive years into the disease with deformities that could have been prevented. A rheumatology-trained doctor identifies which arthritis you have and treats the disease itself, not just its loudest symptom. Early diagnosis is genuinely the single biggest factor in long-term outcome.",

      {
        question: "Which blood tests are needed for arthritis?",
        answer:
          "It depends on what the examination suggests — commonly ESR and CRP for inflammation, RA factor and anti-CCP when rheumatoid arthritis is suspected, and uric acid for gout. Tests are ordered to answer specific questions, not as a fixed panel, and Dr. Patle explains what each result means for your treatment.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is lifelong medicine unavoidable?",
        answer:
          "Not always, but honesty matters here: rheumatoid arthritis usually needs long-term medication to stay in remission, the way blood pressure or diabetes does. Doses are often reduced once the disease is quiet. Gout can frequently be controlled to the point where attacks simply stop. Osteoarthritis may need little or no regular medicine at all if strengthening and weight management go well.",

        question: "Can diet really affect my joint pain?",
        answer:
          "For gout, yes directly — alcohol, red meat, and certain foods provoke attacks in many patients. For other arthritis, diet's biggest role is body weight: every extra kilogram adds roughly four kilograms of load across the knee with each step. No specific food cures arthritis, and we'd encourage skepticism toward anyone who claims otherwise.",

What happens in the following two weeks — not the injury itself — often decides whether they return to sport or join the crowd of people whose knee 'has never been the same since'.",
      "The most common mistake we see in Jabalpur is the injury that was never diagnosed. The swelling went down with rest and a bandage, so everyone assumed it healed. But an ACL doesn't reattach itself, and a torn meniscus doesn't fill back in — the knee works fine on straight-line walking and then betrays you on the first twist.

        answer:
          "Yes — and this exact situation is why. A completely torn ACL often allows comfortable straight-line walking once swelling settles; the instability only shows up on turning, pivoting, or uneven ground. Walking normally tells you very little about ligament status. A clinical examination settles the question quickly, and catching it now prevents the cartilage damage that repeated giving-way causes later.",

        question: "Can an ACL tear heal with rest and exercise alone?",
        answer:
          "A fully torn ACL does not grow back together — that's biology, not opinion. What rehabilitation can do is train the muscles around the knee to compensate, which works well for people with partial tears or less rotationally demanding lives. For those who play pivoting sports or have knees that give way despite good rehab, reconstruction is the reliable option. Which camp you fall into is exactly what the consultation determines.",

        title: "The Surgeon Writes the Brief",
        description:
          "Rehabilitation starts from precise knowledge of your injury or operation — which movements to push, which to protect, and when the next stage is safe.",

        title: "Progress Reviewed, Not Assumed",
        description:
          "Your program is adjusted based on what your joint actually does each week. Plateaus get investigated — sometimes with a same-day X-ray — instead of being exercised through blindly.",
      },
      {
        title: "A Program, Not Just Sessions",
        description:
          "Every stage has a goal: this range by week three, this strength by week six. You always know what you're working toward and how you're tracking against it.",
      },
      {
        title: "Home Exercises You'll Actually Do",
        description:
          "The sessions between clinic visits are where recovery mostly happens, so you learn a short, correct home routine — demonstrated, corrected, and kept realistic for your day.",
      },
    ],
    recoveryNote:
      "In rehabilitation, consistency beats intensity — every time. Fifteen correct minutes daily outperforms a heroic hour once a week. Programs here are deliberately kept small enough to live inside a normal working day, because a perfect program nobody follows is worth less than a modest one done every morning.",

        question: "Do I need to be Dr. Patle's patient to use the physiotherapy centre?",
        answer:
          "New patients are first seen in the OPD so that rehabilitation targets the correct diagnosis — treating 'knee pain' with exercises meant for the wrong condition wastes weeks. After that evaluation, your program runs at the centre with periodic reviews. Existing patients move into rehab as a built-in part of their treatment.",
      },
      {
        question: "How many sessions will I need, honestly?",
        answer:
          "It genuinely varies: post-plaster stiffness often improves substantially inside three to four weeks; ligament and post-surgical programs run longer, in stages. What we commit to is telling you the expected duration at the start, showing you the milestones, and not stretching a program that has met its goals.",
      },
      {
        question: "Physiotherapy hurt when I tried it before. Is that normal?",
        answer:
          "A stretching, working discomfort during sessions is normal — especially when winning back movement a joint has lost. Sharp pain, or pain that leaves the joint worse for days afterward, is not, and it usually means the program needs adjusting rather than enduring. Because the surgeon is on-site, 'this doesn't feel right' gets investigated quickly here.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can exercises really help knee arthritis, or is that just something doctors say?",
        answer:
          "The evidence is solid and the mechanism is simple: the quadriceps muscle is the knee's shock absorber, and strengthening it measurably reduces pain and improves walking in arthritic knees. It requires weeks of consistency before it pays off, which is where most people give up — and where a structured, supervised program earns its keep.",
