const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "How do I book an appointment with Dr. Patle?",
    answer: `You can book online through the Book Appointment page on this website — our team will call you back to confirm your slot. You can also call the clinic directly at ${DOCTOR.phone} (mobile) or ${DOCTOR.landline} (landline) during OPD hours.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What are the OPD timings?",
    answer: `OPD runs ${DOCTOR.opd.days}, in two sessions: Afternoon ${DOCTOR.opd.afternoon} and Evening ${DOCTOR.opd.evening}. The clinic is closed on Sunday.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Where is Patle Health Care Center located?",
    answer: `The clinic is at ${DOCTOR.clinicAddress} — on Main Road in Adhartal, easy to reach from anywhere in Jabalpur. The Contact page has a map with directions.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What should I bring to my first consultation?",
    answer:
      "Bring any previous X-rays, MRI/CT scans, and reports related to your problem, a list of medicines you currently take, and details of any past surgeries or medical conditions. If you don't have prior records, don't worry — evaluation can start fresh, and X-rays can be done at the clinic itself.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get an X-ray done at the clinic?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The clinic has an in-house digital X-ray facility, so imaging is done during your consultation itself when clinically needed — no separate trips to an imaging centre.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is physiotherapy available at the same clinic?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Patle Health Care Center has a dedicated physiotherapy and rehabilitation centre, used for post-operative recovery, fracture rehabilitation, arthritis exercise programs, and sports injury rehab.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Dr. Patle treat arthritis as well as injuries?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Dr. Patle is an orthopaedic surgeon with an additional Fellowship in Rheumatology — so your joint problem is seen with both a surgeon's and a physician's eye. Whether the right answer is medication, physiotherapy, or a procedure, the recommendation is based on what the joint needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a referral to consult?",
    answer:
      "No referral is needed. You can book directly for any bone, joint, muscle, or arthritis-related problem.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after I submit the online booking form?",
    answer:
      "Your request reaches our clinic team immediately. We call you on the mobile number you provided to confirm your appointment slot, usually within clinic hours the same day.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need urgent care outside OPD hours?",
    answer:
      "For emergencies such as major injuries, severe deformity after a fall, or uncontrolled pain, please go to the nearest emergency facility immediately. For urgent but non-emergency concerns, call the clinic and our team will guide you to the earliest available slot.",
